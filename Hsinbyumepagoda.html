				<h5>Hsinbyume Pagoda</h5>
				<p>The pagoda was built in 1816 by Bagyidaw. It is dedicated to the memory of his first consort and cousin, Princess Hsinbyume (ဆင်ဖြူမယ်, lit. Princess White Elephant, 1789–1812) who had died in childbirth in a site nearby.
				The pagoda's design is a great departure from Burmese pagoda design norms. It is based on descriptions of the mythical Sulamani pagoda on Mount Meru, and the lower parts of the pagoda represent the mountain. Seven concentric terraces represent the seven mountain ranges going up to the Mount Meru according to Buddhist mythology.
				The pagoda was badly damaged by an earthquake in 1836 and was restored by King Mindon in 1874.<br>
				Pagoda is unlike any other religious site in the world, and it’s open to explore, walk on, and enjoy. It was built in the early 1800s based on descriptions of the mythical Sulamani Pagoda on Mount Meru. Concentric terraces, totaling seven, represent an equal number of mountains leading up to and surrounding Meru, according to Buddhist mythology, and even if you’re not the spiritual type, you may find yourself starting to believe while exploring Hsinbyume.

			<h6>Recomendation : </h6>
			<p>
				Most people get here by taking a boat from Mandalay’s city center, or stop here in the early morning, because frankly it makes a lot more logistical sense to head there after U Bien. However I knew I wanted to be there for golden hour and sunset, mostly to have nobody else there and to get it in the perfect light. The photo above was taken just after the sun dipped below the horizon. I was very happy with my choice of timing.
